Soundboard
==========

Simple browser based soundboard for various uses.


Release
=======

You can just download the `www/` -directory contents from the [project's Releases -page](https://github.com/lietu/soundboard/releases).


Source code
===========

To use this repository from the source, you'll need to have [bower](http://bower.io/) installed.

Clone this repository, and run `bower install` in the root.


Usage
=====

1. Put sound files (generally MP3 works best) under `www/sounds/`.
1. Edit `www/js/main.js`, namely the `var sounds = ...` -part. Read the comments there.
1. Publish `www/` -folder contents somehow (or not, up to you).
1. Open the webpage (or drag & drop `index.html` on your browser if you didn't publish it)
1. Wait for buttons to turn green.
1. Click on button(s).
1. Be amazed.

It's up to you to make the sound files have the correct amplitude for your use. Alternatively improve on the project by implementing a quick volume slider, it should be easy.
